      <div class="chapter-content" id="chapterContent">
        <p>The Cambridge University Library on West Road was a place where you could literally find anything you needed while studying. Stacks that reach to the ceiling are filled with books all around. The silence is deafening; you need to be careful how you move around, just so you don't disturb anyone there. Jack Thomas perched at his usual desk on the second floor, his research papers scattered all around, his laptop open, and he was typing fast. While most of the papers were printed, they were supplemented by handwritten notes. Everything from neural interfaces to brain imaging data, even the paper he is writing on consciousness mapping.</p>

        <p>Today was the 15th of May, 2025. It was his twentieth birthday. Not that anyone here would know. Jack was not someone to share or care too much about birthdays. Birthdays are not so important when you are trying to change the world, that was Jack's motto. With the paper's deadline tomorrow, nothing else in the world was important; he was almost finished.</p>

        <p>Jack is not a fan of the Easter Term; it is the reason he disengaged from birthday celebrations. It was always something, either school or now uni. Exams are just around the corner, in a few more weeks, and the library was packed with students. Some of them would study on the floor as they had not reserved their desk on time. You could feel the air of panic across the room through the sea of students all cramming in last-minute revision, self-induced panic, of course.</p>

        <p>Jack always reserved the desk at the front. Some sort of safe space for him, people were curious about how he always managed to get such a good spot for days on end. Everyone always admired him for that, despite what seemed like a magical skill to secure it. He grabbed one of the yellow highlighters and marked a passage, "If we can map neural patterns in real-time, can we create a feedback loop? Consciousness existing in both biological and digital space simultaneously?"</p>

        <p>Reading those words got him thinking; he was consumed in his thoughts. It was not just AI that everyone talked about. But, true neural integration. A world where your body would be sleeping but your mind fully awake, inside a digital space, a space where consciousness exists independently of the physical form. This is the world Jack is obsessed with, the tech he wanted in his hands, and this research could be the key to his success. This could revolutionise everything. Jack was definitely determined to be the one who would crack that.</p>

        <p>"Are you seriously going to be doing this on your birthday?"</p>

        <p>Jack looked up. Claire stood next to his desk. One hand on her hip and another one holding a small designer bag that costs more than everyone's personal belongings in this library. She was dressed head to toe in expensive clothes that you see on high-end TV shows. To her, she was in "casual" wear; it screamed old money. A cashmere sweater from Italy, stories had been told of "this old thing". Well, "this old thing" turned out to be a special edition made especially for her when she was visiting the factory in Milan. Perfectly fitted jeans and boots from some old money show maker in central England that only those "in the know" would recognise. Maybe, they were one-offs too, as that's just how her family lived, the price? Who knows! Her dark hair was perfectly messy, and her makeup looked like it took all night just to look effortless. It's like she shared DNA with Charli XCX and the Princess of Wales all at the same time.</p>

        <p>Claire was his friend, sort of. More accurately, she was someone he had known since they were kids. With their families moving in the same social circles, she ended up at Cambridge University too, but in a very different way than Jack did. Her daddy donated millions to add to the science department's budget, as that is what she wanted to be then; now, who knows anymore. I guess money can buy you anything, even a place at Cambridge, but she treated it like an extended social event, which is totally fine for some. Everyone had their own way of dealing with things. Being at Cambridge brings another set of responsibilities in life. A fear of not finishing it was one.</p>

        <p>Jack did not have time for her right now.</p>

        <p>"What do you want?" he asked.</p>

        <p>"I think you should leave all of this and live a little," Claire said, not waiting for him to answer. "Let's go for a cheeky pint. Or a line. Or whatever. Just to have some fun."</p>

        <p>Jack sighed, closing his laptop. "You do know that I am not partying during the revision period?"</p>

        <p>"Come on, it is your birthday. Can you just loosen up for once on your birthday? There is always something." Claire leaned closer, lowering her voice. "I got us a baggy of fun!" She held up a small bag filled with white powder, waving it in front of her face like she was not in the Library at all.</p>

        <p>Jack's eyes almost popped out, and he snatched it from her hand. His heart was beating like a drum. "Stop it! Are you literally insane? Do you want Professor Chen's assistant to snitch on us?" He gestured subtly towards a nearby desk where they were sitting. A student with thick-rimed glasses, surrounded by a stack of psychology textbooks, occasionally glances at Jack. He never actually learned their name, but the assistant always seemed to be studying nearby whenever Jack was in the library. Which led him to believe they had a crush on him.</p>

        <p>Jack had heard rumours that they would always get a desk close to him, specifically asking for it to be close by. They would find the reasons to be close by and sometimes try to chat with Jack, blush whenever Jack would look their way. It was endearing, but Jack always got that feeling of being watched. Absolutely, someone who might report their little baggy to the university.</p>

        <p>Claire rolled her eyes. "Oh, please. Like they would say anything, they are too busy staring at you like you are a piece of meat." She turned around and waved at them as they slumped behind the pages of the notebook. "See, that's sorted. Anyway, where was I? Oh yeah, but Jack," Claire continued, her voice taking on that whining tone she used when she wanted something, "it is a day to remember. You are twenty! That is a milestone."</p>

        <p>"No, it's just a regular Thursday, and I need to finish this before I have to hand it in tomorrow. The deadline is tomorrow," he snapped back. He continued with a sassy "Not that you would know what a deadline is". Jack pushed the bag back towards her, but Claire did not even look at it.</p>

        <p>"You are such a loser." Claire's expression shifted, from a little innocent and playful to bitchy. "Then I will go alone, and I will do it all by myself. I will celebrate you, and I will celebrate for you. In the end, I will just hang with Dean then."</p>

        <p>Dean was Claire's on-and-off boyfriend. A third-year economics student who treated Cambridge like his personal networking event. A finance bro. Jack never liked him much, but that was not his business.</p>

        <p>"Yeah, go ahead. Ruin your life." The words came out harsher than intended, but it was normal, as Jack was stressed, tired, and Claire was being pretty annoying today.</p>

        <p>"Don't you worry, I will not." Claire's voice changed "Daddy will pay for me to finish uni anyway, why are you even bothering with that? Your parents practically own the place."</p>

        <p>Jack's eyes widened, and he stood up abruptly; his chair shrieked on the floor. He moved towards Claire, "Shhh." he shushed her, looking around them to see if anyone was listening. They were too far from anyone to actually hear them talking, but he could not take chances. He leaned closer, his voice dropping to a harsh whisper right next to her ear. "I don't want you to say that out loud ever again. You should not know that, and I don't want anyone else to know that. I am studying because I believe in something other than money. I am doing this to have something of my own".</p>

        <p>Jack wanted to carve his own way in life; he is intelligent and doesn't want to live in his family's shadow. He has lived a life of being the middle child, where everything is his fault, and he is the black sheep of the family. He was annoyed as Claire didn't have these problems, "You just would not understand the pressure I am under, you have it easy in your family". Things drastically change when the middle one is a girl, as that is what the parents wanted, a boy and then a girl, but they got another boy with Jack. "I am doing this so people don't think I came for money but earned it myself."</p>

        <p>He pulled back, looking around, seeing a few students looking at them, disturbed by the ruckus. In true British form, they looked away as soon as he looked at them. The research assistant at the nearby desk was watching them, though their expression was unreadable behind those thick glasses. This was more than what Jack would usually say, more vulnerable than his default. But yes, Jack's family is indeed wealthy, traditional English old money wealthy. The kind that came with expectations and comparisons. God forbid if you dress in something that would put a bad name on the family. That was one of the reasons why Jack changed his name before university. He did not want to be associated with his family in any way.</p>

        <p>While his dad would rather show up on the coattails of their name, he understood the reason behind it and how it could harm him in the long run and the only reason he would let him change his name. His older brother was a successful finance bro, and his younger sister was thinking about being a lawyer. And Jack, Jack is the one who chose to research and study something that was not in their family before. If you were not someone who would command to bring in the money rather than earn it with hard graft, then you were looked at as "different" in the family. Jack was keen to do this himself and not on the family name.</p>

        <p>Claire yawned, the gesture that was deliberately theatrical. "You are so boring, I am leaving." She turned to leave, and Jack felt a mix of relief and guilt. He definitely should have been nicer, as she really did try, in her own way. If it were just another day, Jack would be the first to say yes, as he does not mind a cheeky line when it is the right place and time. He had work to do, and good thing that he said no to it, as this version of Claire's celebration would derail everything. Jack was keen on his deadline, birthday or not!</p>

        <p>As she walked away, Jack tried to grab the bag on the desk to hide it, but instead it slipped from his fingers and fell to the floor. "Shit.", Jack muttered. He dropped to his knees in search of the bag, reaching under the desk, looking for it. The bag had slid to the other end of the desk. It had settled between the far end desk leg and a stack of books that someone had left on the floor. Jack stretched his fingers to grab it. He could hear Claire's voice in the background. "Are you blind? Watch where you are going. This is Italian cashmere, you are going to ruin it with your-"</p>

        <p>There was something in her tone, something that Jack had not heard before, something that would make your blood run cold. He grabbed the bag, his fingers clenched around it, and he heard a loud noise.</p>

        <p>A gunshot.</p>

        <p>Deafening, sharp, and then silence for a split second before, thud, as a body hit the floor. After that, all he could hear was screams, the sound of panic erupting. As he was under the desk, he could not see anything. His body reacted before his brain, grabbing his phone from his pocket, and he then slowly crawled towards the bookshelves, where he could hide for a while. He moved himself into the narrow space between two shelves, pressing himself against the books, trying to be as quiet as possible.</p>

        <p>Another gunshot. More screams, and another gunshot.</p>

        <p>The shooter was moving through the library, quickly and methodically.</p>

        <p>Jack's hands were shaking so badly that he almost dropped his phone. He fumbled with it, and his fingers slipped on the screen as he tried to unlock it. "Call 999," he whispered into a phone. "Calling 999." The phone responded loudly. "Fuck, stupid phone", he muttered.</p>

        <p>You could not hear gunshots for a few seconds before it fired again, and again. Felt more like targeted than random shooting. After every gunshot, there would also be the sound of people falling to the ground after being shot. The screams, panicked footsteps, the sounds of chairs scraping and desks moving, books tumbling. All he could hear was a hundred different things, but nothing to see from where he was.</p>

        <p>He pressed the phone to his ear, lowering the sound as it was ringing. "Emergency services, what is your-"</p>

        <p>"There is a shooter," Jack gasped, interrupting the person on the other side. His voice was barely above a whisper. "Cambridge University Library, West Road. There is a shooter, people are-"</p>

        <p>Another gunshot, closer to him this time.</p>

        <p>"Sir, can you-"</p>

        <p>"I have to go," said Jack, interrupting the person on the call and ending the call. He shoved the phone into his pocket, thinking of what was next. The screams kind of toned down as it could be that the shooter had already killed half of the library. He could hear footsteps coming closer and closer, and all he could think of was how to stop it.</p>

        <p>"They are killing everyone, and I will be next." Jack's mind was racing, and he needed to do something; he needed to get out, and the main exit was on the ground floor. He was on the upper floor, and from what he could tell, the shooter was in between him and the stairs. Jack's heart was beating so fast that he could feel his pulse in his throat.</p>

        <p>The footsteps were getting closer and closer. Jack crawled slowly towards the end of the bookshelf to see where the shooter was and if there was a way for him to just get away, but unfortunately, the shooter saw him, and footsteps could be heard moving toward him. It was stupid of him to do that. What now? He decided he would make the first move. He got up fast, ran around the bookshelf, low and fast, trying to tackle the shooter, not knowing that he was going to fail.</p>

        <p>The shooter saw him coming and was faster than Jack expected. More prepared at people jump at them. The gun swung around, and he just saw the muzzle flash before he felt the impact. The first bullet tore through his shoulder. The pain just exploded through his body, so intense that it made him stop for a second. He tried to reach for a gun with his other arm, but his momentum was gone. He stumbled, and his legs kind of gave out beneath him. The second bullet hit his side, and he felt it going through him. Falling on his back, he felt warm blood spreading under him.</p>

        <p>"This was a mistake, I am going to die," Jack whispered as he stopped feeling the pain in his body. His strength was being drained from him so fast.</p>

        <p>The shooter stood over him, and Jack saw his face with a big smile on it, like he enjoyed all of this. The shooter calmly said, "You tried to be a hero, that was so stupid."</p>

        <p>The gun lowered, pointed directly at Jack's head, and all he could see was the bullet in the chamber. The shooter's finger is tightening on that trigger. He could see his own death coming.</p>

        <p>"I am going to die on my birthday, because I was stupid." Jack thought about it, thought it was almost absurd, almost funny, if it weren't so terrifying. The shooter pulled the trigger, and then-</p>

        <p>The world went silent.</p>

        <p>One moment, Jack was staring at the gun and bleeding on the library floor, surrounded by probably 50 bodies of people who had been killed just moments before. But then everything stopped. Like time has stopped. The muzzle flash from the gun that had just fired at him was suspended in the air, frozen in time. The bullet itself, a tiny piece of metal that would have ended his life, was there, just centimetres from him.</p>

        <p>A translucent blue screen materialised in front of him, hovering in the air like a hologram.</p>
